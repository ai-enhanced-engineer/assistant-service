This file is an empty placeholder that is replaced by specific client implementations if the tool calling feature
was activated for a specific assistant. The variable TOOL_MAP below is a key value map where the name of the tool
is used as a string key and the value is a programmatic reference to the function to be invoked. See examples in:
'assistant_factory/client_spec/{CLIENT_ID}/tools.py'

Test comment for co-author functionality validation.
